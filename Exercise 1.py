# About "Variables" #
# Imagine we're going to write a program for a hospital.
# So we check in a patient named John Smith.
# He's 20 years old and is a new patient.
# I want you to define 3 variables here; for his name, his age, and another variable to tell if this is a new or -
# -an existing patient.

Patient_name = 'John Smith'
Patient_age = 20
is_new = True
print(Patient_name)
print(Patient_age)
print(is_new)
