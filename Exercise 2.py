# I want you to extend the "Getting input" program and Ask two questions:
# Person's name and Favorite color.
# Then, print a message like "Parsa likes blue"

name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Hi ' + name)
favorite_color = input('And what is your favorite color? ')
print('Parsa likes ' + favorite_color)
